# hive-fillit

## Description
A group project with Bengisu Kandemir at Hive Helsinki.

Fillit is a project that aims to create an algorithm that arranges the given tetriminos into the smallest possible square.  Bonus points if the algorithm is also fast.

The only allowed functions are open, close, read, write, malloc, free and exit. The program must not contain any memory leaks and cannot be compiled with optimization flags.

For further explanation here is a really good one: https://github.com/JemWritesCode/42-Fillit

Compile the libft library
```
cd libft
make
cd ..
```
